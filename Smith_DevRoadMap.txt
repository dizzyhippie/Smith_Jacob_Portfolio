Dev Roadmap Document

Gallery Function:
The gallery will display small tiles with a little bit of information about the project: type, client or school, industry, etc. When the user clicks on these tiles a modal will pop up in the centre of the screen. Inside the modal will be an in depth explanation of the project and will have some sort of image gallery showing different pieces. This may be slider option to show multiple photos so the modal does not get too long or require scrolling. This will be a bigger challenge on the mobile sizes as width is limited. The modal will have a button to close out and may include another set of buttons to change projects without exiting the modal.

About Info Function:
On the about page there will be a menu to cycle through 3 different types of information. The Menu will include: About Me, Developer Skills, Designer Skills. The menu will have 3 links to click on and will cycle through the information stored in an array from the database.
